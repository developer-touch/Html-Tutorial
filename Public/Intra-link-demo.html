                    Java is a widely used <a href="#oops">object-oriented programming language</a> and software platform that runs on billions of devices, including notebook computers, mobile devices, gaming consoles, medical devices and many others. The rules and syntax of Java are based on the C and C++ languages.
                    One major advantage of developing software with Java is its portability. Once you wrote code for a Java program on a notebook computer, it can be easily moved to a mobile device. When the language was invented in 1991 by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems (later acquired by Oracle), the primary goal was to be able to "write once, run anywhere."
                    It's also important to understand that Java is much different from JavaScript. JavaScript does not need to be compiled, while Java code needs to be. Also, Javascript only runs on web browsers, while Java can be run anywhere.

                    The answer to "What is advanced Java?" is that it's a sub-category of the Java programming language. Java is a general-purpose language that can run on a variety of platforms. It has a similar syntax to C or C++ and is one of the most popular coding languages. It's also a relatively longstanding coding language, as it first appeared in 1995. Java was created to be simple, object-oriented, secure, portable, high-performing, and dynamic.
                    The key difference between core Java and advanced Java is that advanced Java is more technologically complex and has multi-tiered architecture instead of single-tiered. Advanced Java is capable of dealing with socked and database applications. Developers use advanced Java for web-based applications, while they use core Java for general purpose applications.

                    Spring is the most popular application development framework for enterprise Java. Millions of developers around the world use Spring Framework to create high performing, easily testable, and reusable code.
                    Spring framework is an open source Java platform. It was initially written by Rod Johnson and was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003.
                    Spring is lightweight when it comes to size and transparency. The basic version of Spring framework is around 2MB.
                    The core features of the Spring Framework can be used in developing any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE platform. Spring framework targets to make J2EE development easier to use and promotes good programming practices by enabling a POJO-based programming model.

                    Microservices is an architectural approach to build a collection of logic, data layers, and loosely coupled applications. Every microservices deals with one business function end-to-end independently from other microservices. Microservices present simple and understandable APIs to communicate with each other through lightweight

With the increasing demand for Microservices Architecture Patterns in the industry the popularity of Spring Boot is also increasing because when it comes to Microservices Development , Spring Boot is the first choice of every developer. Spring Boot is a microservice-based framework that makes a

                <p>
                    DevSecOps, which is short for development, security and operations, is an application development practice that automates the integration of security and security practices at every phase of the software development lifecycle, from initial design through integration, testing, delivery and deployment.
                    DevSecOps represents a natural and necessary evolution in the way development organizations approach security. In the past, security was 'tacked on' to software at the end of the development cycle, almost as an afterthought. A separate security team applied these security measures and then a separate quality assurance (QA) team tested these measures.
                    This ability to handle security issues was manageable when software updates were released just once or twice a year. But as software developers adopted Agile and DevOps practices, aiming to reduce software development cycles to weeks or even days, the traditional 'tacked-on' approach to security created an unacceptable bottleneck.
                    DevSecOps integrates application and infrastructure security seamlessly into Agile and DevOps processes and tools. It addresses security issues as they emerge, when they're easier, faster, and less expensive to fix, and before deployment into production.
                    Additionally, DevSecOps makes application and infrastructure security a shared responsibility of development, security and IT operations teams, rather than the sole responsibility of a security silo. It enables “software, safer, sooner”—the DevSecOps motto–by automating the delivery of secure software without slowing the software development cycle.

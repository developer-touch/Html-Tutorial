                The title element represents the document's title or name. Authors 
                should use titles that identify their documents even when they are 
                used out of context, for example in a user's history or bookmarks, 
                or in search results. The document's title is often different from 
                its first heading, since the first heading does not have to stand 
                alone when taken out of context.

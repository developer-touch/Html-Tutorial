        Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet 
        (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range
        from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, 
        electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks
        to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, 
        Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web 
        server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.Among Web 
        professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of 
        building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content 
        management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic 
        technical skills.
